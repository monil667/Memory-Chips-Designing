# Memory-Project
RAM is a type of volatile memory used for temporary data storage that requires read and write capabilities. In Verilog, RAM can be designed using behavioral or structural modeling. 
Here's an overview of the process

1.Specification:
We have defined the size of the RAM as 256kb, also 
We have defined type as Static RAM Array.


2.Module Definition:
We Created a Verilog module specifying input and output ports, including address lines, data lines, control signals (read/write enable), and clock.

3.Behavioral Modeling:

We Used Verilog constructs like always blocks to describe the read and write operations.
We also Used a register array to model the memory storage.
